These are the customized code utilized in the Pattison et al. 2018 Nature Genetics paper. Author of the code is Samantha Piekos.

Deg1LoopChecker.py is a custom python3 script that identifies two distal genomic elements that are connected to each other via chromatin looping ensuring that each element is in it's own individual contact bin. It writes information on the coordinates of the two elements and the associated chromatin loop to an output file.
